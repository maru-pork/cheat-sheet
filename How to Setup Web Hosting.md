[Web hosting vs Domain Registration](https://www.shivarweb.com/12970/web-hosting-vs-domain-registration/)  

*Web Hosting and Domain Registration* are two elements of running a website. 

***Web Hosting*** is an account on a computer (aka server) that can store and serve website files via the Internet.

***Domain Registration*** is leasing a human-readable word (e.g., amazon.com) that directs people to specific website files via a browser.

As an analogy, a domain is an *“address”* on the Internet. Hosting is the *“land”* or space where your website files live.
